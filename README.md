# README manual - How I work and like to work with you

## About this document

If you start working with a new person, wouldn’t it be nice if you had some sort of user guide that gives you a basic understanding of how to work with them? 

Welcome to my README. This document is a user guide on me and how I work. It captures my guiding principles and how I work as a human. Hopefully, it will help you understand me better and allow us to work together more meaningfully. 
Inevitably, I will sometimes fail to live up to my own ideals. I will always try, and this is here so you can hold me accountable. 
This is a living document. It is incomplete and will continue to grow and change as I grow and change.

## Who I am & disabilities

*I am diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)*, social anxiety, and clinical depression which are considered disabilities. I've been described as neurodivergent. My medical and mental health journey is a continuing one. My biggest ask before reading further is to learn how to work with employees with disabilities. I try to avoid code-switching (adjusting my style of speech, appearance, behavior, and mannerisms in ways that will increase the comfort of others in exchange for fair treatment). For people with disabilities, these expectations can result in people being mistreated in the name of "teaching" neurodiverse people to suppress their neurobiology. [Here is an article I've found helpful.](https://hbr.org/2022/10/stop-asking-neurodivergent-people-to-change-the-way-they-communicate) 

*I’m an introvert*, my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is INTJ. I’m most comfortable in smaller settings with people I know well. **Prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me.** Especially in larger groups, I won’t engage as much as I would in smaller ones. It also means I’m sometimes slow in expressing what I truly feel.

Related to the above, I sometimes write messages when we should be talking instead. Please point it out to me if this is not ideal. 

I used to have trouble with work life balance. I still do, but I'm much better about it. Please respect my attempt at a work life balance - I need my time and breaks at the gym or ice rink.  

## My premise

Things I believe to be true, that are the foundation of us working together.

**1. We trust each other:** I assume good intent. I trust I know what I'm doing. I trust you know what you're doing. We will let each other know when we need help. My default working mode will be that I trust you and that you trust me, unless a situation arises and if then, I hope we can work to rebuild our trust. 

**2. There is a safe space:** I feel safe talking to you, and you feel the same about me. Ideas usually get better when we look at them from all angles. If you feel I’m asking too many questions, it is because I want to have a better understanding of the overall context. If you feel I am overthinking, it is because I want to help find the best possible solution. If one of us feels our goals or motives aren’t aligned, let's talk.

**3. We support one another:** If there is anything that prevents me from doing my best work, I will let you know. If it’s something related to myself, I will try to fix it. If it's something related to you, my hope is you will try to fix it. If it’s beyond us, we will try and find a solution together. 

## What I value / appreciate when others also value

**Context-awareness.** Nothing that we do happens in a vacuum. In fact, making the right decisions is foremost about understanding the context we’re operating in. This can be anything from interpersonal to organisation-wide, from understanding customer needs to market forces and policy constraints.

**Self-reflection.** We can’t improve if we remain unaware of our weak spots. We should all regularly take time to reflect on why we made a certain decision, why we reacted in a certain way.

**Critical-thinking.** If I spot something that could be improved, my bias for action leads me to almost always say something or volunteer to help fix it. Nothing is sacred, and “Because we’ve always done it this way” is not a work culture. 

**Empathy.** Not just towards our coworkers, but anybody. We’re all humans, and often times you see things more clearly when you take someone else’s perspective.

## How to efficiently work and communicate with me

**1. Please don’t hold back:** Challenge my ideas and opinions. If you notice that I‘m making a bad decision, let me know and explain what I should be doing differently. If you truly liked something I did — I like to hear that too. My instinct is to treat you the same, so if you would prefer to be approached differently, please let me know. 

**2. Be collaborative:** I’m very collaborative which means I like to discuss decisions and options. I will rarely get stuck in one position or opinion, I have a very open mind but the downside is you won’t always get a quick judgment out of me—I prefer to talk it through and see some ideas/data/options. If you need a decision quickly, make sure I know it. 

**3. Mind the channel:** Ask me what the best form of communication is (email, Slack, written, voice note, Zoom meeting with camera on or off, etc) with the understanding that it can depend on the situation, or even day. I usually prefer a short written message as a first point of contact. It’s unintrusive and allows me to decide when and how to continue the conversation. You might prefer something else — let me know. 
- I'm very active on Slack and read most messages, but I try not to respond in the evening or on weekends unless it's an emergency or I've pre-arranged to work outside standard hours.

**4. Clarify:** Don’t give clues or expect me to read between the lines. Tell me what you need. I enjoy direct and clear communication. That means clarifying the purpose of a meeting, a brainstorm, an initiative. If my own communication was lost in translation, I'd love some initial empathy and active listening: "What did you actually mean when you said X? I interpreted what you said as Y, is that right?" I don't want to feel like what I say doesn't have value, it only matters how I say it (omitting inappropriate behavior).  

**5. Use the power of async:** An important update can be sent via email. Feedback can be gathered in a shared doc. Questions can be answered in a direct message. Decisions can be reached without everyone in the same room. Async is not always best, but it’s a good default. It gives people the freedom to choose the right moment and the time they need to engage. I understand this can't be applied to everything, but I work best when it's applied to where it can. 
- If you invite me to a meeting, I need to understand why it’s valuable that I’ll be there. I like meetings that are respectful of everyone’s time and contributions. 

## How to give me feedback and how I give feedback

I often feel uncomfortable giving feedback - I'm not naturally good at it. I truly enjoy receiving feedback; a strength of mine is the ability to separate the business and personal aspect of things. A few guiding principles to help me be better at giving and receiving feedback:

- Before giving me feedback, please ask if I'm ready to receive feedback. I will do the same with you unless you state otherwise. If I'm ready to receive feedback, I might initially ask for written detail to help me digest and prepare if we decide to also have a 1:1 meeting. If I get a sudden mysterious meeting on my schedule or a vague Slack, I tend to automatically go to worst-case scenario.
- Feedback is best when it’s candid and direct, and when it focuses on how the recipient can grow. Let’s give each other feedback on how we give feedback, and get better at it.
- Feedback might take me a while to give, or respond to, if I don’t find the right words straight away, which happens.
- I tend to not give feedback after I’ve noticed something, unless directly asked. Hypocritically, I prefer to get feedback as it happens. If I hear about something for the first time at a review I feel like I've really screwed up.

## How to discuss (or argue)

In passionate discussions, things can become tense, so it’s important to keep some guiding principles in mind. I try to stick to these:

- I start with the assumption that we are talking because we all want to solve the same issue, with the best intentions in mind.
- I try to truly understand a position before making any points against it. I ask questions. I repeat back what I understood to be their point.
- I find it helpful to state how uncertain I am when I make a statement. Asking «How sure are you?» is better than asking «Are you sure?»
- Know when to end a discussion. Sometimes a decision needs to be made. Sometimes additional information needs to be gathered to continue the discussion. Always end a discussion with everyone knowing what will happen next.
- If a discussion went off the rails, let’s follow-up later to talk about what went wrong and what we can learn from it. 


## Questions you might be interested in asking for our [first 1:1](https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/)

I've answered a few for you already:

**What pronouns do you use?**

she/her

**What makes you grumpy?**

* vague or unclear requests without details
* being under 80% (feeling lazy) or over 105% capacity (feeling overworked)
* too many unplanned extra demands 
* a meeting that could've been an email
* when people don't share agendas or presentations beforehand or after 
* feeling required to attend social meetings for work when my social barometer is full
* always being too cold in the office

**How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public/private)**

My love language is not words of appreciation but that doesn't mean I don't want any. I enjoy recognition in a forum where leadership will notice and it will help any future career development. If I look uncomfortable it's because I'm an introvert - I'm fine, don't worry.

**What do you need from your manager?**

Reassurance that my work continues to be good (if applicable); direction on how to achieve goals that I've asked about; continuing conversations on how to demonstrate promotion qualities; help shifting around workload if it gets overwhelming; advocacate for me to those who might not have direct access to me or my work.

**From your team?**

Feeling comfortable asking questions and being asked questions; being a sounding board for solving problems; help for areas outside my expertise; camaraderie.

**From your peers? (outside the team)**

Being able to ask questions and collaborate rather than receiving or giving orders or throwing something over the fence; exchanging ideas.

**What's your favorite food?**

I can't turn down fries.
